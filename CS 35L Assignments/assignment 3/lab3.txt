1. I used wget to fetch the compressed file with the below command:
   wget ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/coreutils/coreutils-7.6.tar.gz
   Then I extracted files by:
   tar -xzvf coreutils-7.6.tar.gz
   and I saw a folder coreutils-7.6   
2. I created a temporary directory coreutilsInstall by the command:
   mkdir coreutilsInstall
3. In the coreutils-7.6 directory, I run the configure as below:
   ./configure --prefix=/w/home.02/cs/ugrad/guan/coreutilsInstall
   (I used readlink -f filename to get the absolute path of the directory)
4. The I compiled it using 'make', and installed it using 'make install'.
5. Then in the coreutilsInstall folder, there are three subfolders, 
bin  lib  share. using cd bin, and inside bin, I saw the 'ls' command. 
Both inside the bin folder and coreutils-7.6/src folder, I reproduced 
the bug by running the command as below:
   ./ls -l /bin/bash
   I got a result as:
   -rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 940416 2014-09-26 03:29 /bin/bash
6. cd coreutils-7.6, and I used emacs to copy the patch file from the web page 
that was given, and saved this file as patch_file. Then I run the below command:
   patch -p1 < patch_file
   Then I got the below message:
   "patching file NEWS
   Hunk #1 succeeded at 397 with fuzz 2 (offset 365 lines).
   patching file src/ls.c
   Hunk #1 succeeded at 2013 (offset -1 lines).
   patch unexpectedly ends in middle of line
   Hunk #2 succeeded at 2028 with fuzz 1 (offset -1 lines)." 
7. Then in the coreutils-7.6/src folder, I run 'make' to rebuild 'ls'. 
After this, inside this folder, I run:
   ./ls -l /bin/bash
   and I got the expected result as:
   -rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 940416 Sep 26 03:29 /bin/bash  
   Then I went back to the temporary folder coreutilsInstall and inside the 
bin folder, I run the same command, but it still gives the old result: 
( -rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 940416 2014-09-26 03:29 /bin/bash)
8. To test the patched ls on both a new file and an old file that over a 
year, I used 'touch' command:
   touch file1 (this gives a new file)
   touch -t 1205050100 file2 (creates an artficial 'old' file at 
05/05, 1999, the time 01:00 is not shown)
   The modified 'ls' gives me:
   -rw-r--r--  1 guan csugrad        0 Jan 22 00:30 file1
   -rw-r--r--  1 guan csugrad        0 May  5  2012 file2
   While the installed 'ls' still gives me:
   -rw-r--r--  1 guan csugrad        0 2015-01-22 00:30 file1
   -rw-r--r--  1 guan csugrad        0 2012-05-05 01:00 file2
   which are expected.
